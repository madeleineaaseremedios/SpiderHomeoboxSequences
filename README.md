Annotation of homeodomain sequences from spider and other arthropod genomes

Aase-Remedios et al. (2023) MBE doi:

This dataset contains three files:
1. Excel table of homeodomain sequences from select arthropod genomes. This contains the classification, genomic location, and the sequences of all homeodomains identified in each genome.
2. NK and NK2 clusters full and curated protein sequence alignment.
3. Irx cluster full and curated protein sequence alignment.
